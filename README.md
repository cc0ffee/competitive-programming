## Competitive Programming

Hello! I am cc00ffee, also known as hot latte.

This is my repo for any competitive programming problems I have solved. I mainly use two sites: codechef and codeforces. You can check out my profile on both of them (will link soon).

Why am I doing this? First, I want to do competitive programming since I feel like my coding has been off for a bit, maybe because all my CS classes currently aren't focus on stuff like this. Second, I want to put this in a repo to look back on how I can improve on solutions aswell as reference them in further competitions.

I will update more in this readme file soon.
